# Process

The patient arrives and checks in with the tool.

The tool uses NLP to understand the patient's needs and preferences, such as their preferred doctor, specialty, and time of day.

The tool then uses facial recognition to identify the doctors who are present in the hospital.

The tool then uses a real-time database to check the doctors' availability.

The tool then assigns the patient to the most suitable doctor and books their appointment.

The patient is then notified of their appointment time and location.
